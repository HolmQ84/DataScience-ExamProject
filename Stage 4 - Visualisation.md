Objective: Present the process and results of the analysis in human-understandable form.

Extend your solution with a design of advanced visualisation of business data scenarios and results.

1. Deploy the model on localhost web server.


2. Create simple interface for accessing and using the model


3. Design alternative/complementing interface, which provides extended user experience.
   1. Consider applying animation, 3D visualisation, and VR/AR/MR (extended reality) techniques at least at a conceptual level
   2. If impossible to implement, draw your ideas on paper or digital surface and add the image to your project assets.
   3. Elaborate on the benefits of applying the above-mentioned visualisation techniques for data analytics.

###3 Design alternative/complementing interface, which provides extended user experience.
We are very familiar with the concepts of graphs and charts, when visualizing data. This is because we tend to understand
data in forms better than when just looking at numbers on a piece of paper.\

Modern datasets are multivariate, and can be hard to understand sometimes. But if we could implement our

####iii : Elaborate on the benefits of applying the above-mentioned visualisation techniques for data analytics.
Imagine having a 360 degree sphere of space to show your data. Without having to jump between windows to see the\ 
different parts of the dataset. 
Bloomberg made a proof of concept as shown below:

By showing data in this way, it could be easier to keep the grand overview of what is happening at multiple places at\
a time.
The idea of showing data like mentioned above isn't the only benefit of merging the concepts of VR and data science.\
Stepping into the realm of virtual reality with data science also opens up a whole new area of possibilities for operating\
on data. Take for instance our project where we are trying to analyse and work on data regarding music and the artists behind.\
Here we are collecting all kinds of data on every single track in our effort to find a connection between the song and the\
mood in the song, if the given song would be able to reach the hit list on spotify and so on. Imagine if one could\
-in virtual reality- look at a song, grab it and from this node extract all the audio features.\ 
Then when looking at the features, imagine twerking the "Danceability" or the "Energy" of the song, and experience live\
how this will impact the data and placement of the data in the virtual space.

Using VR with data science gives new opportunities to how we perceive and experience data, and herby also how we learn\ 
from the data we are exploring.
